  # Fix RLS policies for oms_customers table

  1. Security Changes
    - Update RLS policies for oms_customers table to allow proper access
    - Allow anonymous users to read customers for order tracking
    - Allow authenticated users (staff) to create and manage customers
    - Ensure policies work with the current authentication system

  2. Policy Updates
    - Update INSERT policy to allow staff to create customers
    - Update SELECT policies for both anonymous and authenticated access
    - Update UPDATE policy for staff to modify customer data
