# Bug Report: New Order Modal Not Appearing

## Bug ID
BUG-OMS-001

## Date Reported
January 27, 2025

## Reporter
System Administrator

## Severity
High - Critical functionality impacted

## Priority
P1 - Immediate attention required

## Environment
- **Application**: Order Management System (OMS)
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **URL**: https://localhost:5173/oms/dashboard
- **User Role**: All OMS users (admin, store_manager, sales_staff)

## Bug Summary
When users click the "New Order" button in the Orders tab of the OMS Dashboard, the order creation modal/form does not appear, preventing users from creating new orders.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to OMS login page
2. Log in with valid OMS credentials (any role)
3. Click on the "Orders" tab in the dashboard
4. Locate and click the "New Order" button
5. **Expected**: New Order modal/form should appear
6. **Actual**: Nothing happens - no modal appears

## Expected Behavior
- Clicking "New Order" should open a modal dialog containing:
  - Customer selection/creation fields
  - Order type selection (new_stitching/alterations)
  - Garment type input
  - Priority level selection
  - Measurement options
  - Fabric details
  - Delivery date picker
  - Special instructions field
  - Save/Cancel buttons

## Actual Behavior
- No visual feedback when clicking the button
- No modal appears
- No error messages displayed
- Button appears clickable but non-functional

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause Investigation
Based on code analysis of `/src/pages/oms/OMSDashboard.tsx`:

1. **Missing State Management**: The dashboard component lacks state to control modal visibility
2. **Missing Modal Component**: No `NewOrderModal` component is imported or rendered
3. **Incomplete Event Handler**: The "New Order" button likely has no click handler or a non-functional one

### Code Issues Identified

#### In OMSDashboard.tsx:
```typescript
// ISSUE 1: Missing state for modal control
// Should have: const [showNewOrderModal, setShowNewOrderModal] = useState(false);

// ISSUE 2: Missing import
// Should have: import NewOrderModal from './components/NewOrderModal';

// ISSUE 3: Missing modal render
// Should have modal component in JSX with conditional rendering

// ISSUE 4: Button handler not implemented
// New Order button needs onClick handler to show modal
```

#### In NewOrderModal.tsx:
- Component exists but may not be properly integrated
- Props interface may be incomplete
- Form submission logic may be missing

## Impact Assessment
- **Business Impact**: Critical - Users cannot create new orders
- **User Experience**: Severe degradation - core functionality broken
- **Data Integrity**: No immediate risk (no data corruption)
- **System Stability**: No system crashes, but functionality completely broken

## Affected Components
1. `src/pages/oms/OMSDashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard component
2. `src/pages/oms/components/NewOrderModal.tsx` - Modal component
3. Order creation workflow
4. Customer selection process
5. Measurements integration

## Browser Console Errors
- No JavaScript errors reported
- No network request failures
- Silent failure - button click has no effect

## Workarounds
**None available** - This is core functionality with no alternative path for order creation.

## Fix Requirements

### Immediate Fixes Needed:
1. **Add Modal State Management**
   ```typescript
   const [showNewOrderModal, setShowNewOrderModal] = useState(false);
   ```

2. **Import NewOrderModal Component**
   ```typescript
   import NewOrderModal from './components/NewOrderModal';
   ```

3. **Add Button Click Handler**
   ```typescript
   const handleNewOrder = () => setShowNewOrderModal(true);
   ```

4. **Render Modal Conditionally**
   ```typescript
   {showNewOrderModal && (
     <NewOrderModal
       isOpen={showNewOrderModal}
       onClose={() => setShowNewOrderModal(false)}
       onOrderCreated={handleOrderCreated}
     />
   )}
   ```

5. **Implement Order Creation Handler**
   ```typescript
   const handleOrderCreated = (order) => {
     // Refresh orders list
     // Show success message
     // Close modal
   };
   ```

### Testing Requirements:
1. Verify modal opens on button click
2. Test form validation
3. Test order creation flow
4. Test modal close functionality
5. Verify orders list refresh after creation
6. Test across different user roles
7. Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Dependencies
- Customer service integration
- Measurements service integration
- Order service API
- Form validation utilities
- Date picker component
- File upload functionality (for images)

## Estimated Fix Time
- **Development**: 2-4 hours
- **Testing**: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: 3-6 hours

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Fix involves UI state management only
- **No Database Changes**: Required
- **No API Changes**: Required
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained

## Additional Notes
- This appears to be a frontend integration issue rather than a backend problem
- The NewOrderModal component exists but is not properly connected
- All supporting services (customer, order, measurements) appear to be functional
- Issue likely introduced during recent refactoring or component reorganization

## Verification Steps (Post-Fix)
1. ✅ New Order button shows visual feedback on click
2. ✅ Modal opens with all required fields
3. ✅ Form validation works correctly
4. ✅ Customer selection/creation functions
5. ✅ Order creation saves to database
6. ✅ Orders list refreshes after creation
7. ✅ Modal closes properly
8. ✅ Success/error messages display correctly
9. ✅ All user roles can create orders
10. ✅ Cross-browser functionality confirmed
